# Johns Hopkins Blacklight solr configuration

Solr is used by catalyst (blacklight_jh).
We have the following solr servers which are each configured differntly and are on ageing infrastructure.  This is an attempt to capture the current server configuration and function, so we can replace it with more consitant and automated infrastructure. 

We are using a master/slave approach. The slave copy is used by Catalyst to handle user searches. Indexing is done on the master so that the indexing process does not degrade performance of Catalyst. The master index is replicated to the slave every night. 

- catsolrmaster.library.jhu.edu (Production)
- catsolrslave.library.jhu.edu  (Production)
- solr03.mse.jhu.edu            (Demo, Development)
- blacklight.library.jhu.edu    (Development)

This solr configuration is on multiple servers

## catsolrmaster (prod) tomcat6
This is not a JHED enable server. 

The master solr index runs every night, it indexes horizon, and other sources of data.
(all other solr indexes point to this for replication).

TODO Determine the impact on running the indexing during the week.
TODO Ensure the server comes back after a restart with all services started and in a ready state

This server has a impressive uptime of > 270 days. But suffered some resent downtime.
